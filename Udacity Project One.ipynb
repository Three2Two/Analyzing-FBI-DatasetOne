    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is part of the Data Analysis Nano-Degree program offered by Udacity Google. For this project, I chose to use the data from the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which is used by gun shops to determine if a future buyer is eligible to buy firearms or explosives. The data consists of two data sets: NICS data that provides the number of background checks from FBI uopn any firearm purchases, and CENSUS DATA that provides demographic and socio-economic data related variables. Such data is very useful in preventing crime and protecting people from harm by not letting firearms to fall in the arms of criminals. It also offers valuable insights such as: spikes in firearms sales over specific periods in time( e.g protests ). The NICS data set for this analysis comes from GitHub and can be accessed here: NICS Data. This data set is supplemented with state level data from census.org that can be accessed here: census data. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### A few things to note before we get started: \n",
    "\n",
    "##### A. Firearm Background Checks Do Not Equal Sales\n",
    "##### B. States cannot be directly compared\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis will try to explore the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. What is the overall trend over time of firearms purchases?       \n",
    "  2. Which states have had the highest growth in firearms registrations?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the PDF files the FBI provides, there is an important note:\n",
    "\n",
    "These statistics represent the number of firearm background checks initiated through the NICS They do not represent the number of firearms sold Based on varying state laws and purchase scenarios, a one-to-one correlation cannot be made between a firearm background check and a firearm sale\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though a one-to-one correlation cannot be made between a check and a sale, some organizations have estimated gun sales with this data. For example, the New York Times used a method suggested in the Small Arms Survey by Jurgen Brauer, a professor at Georgia Regents University. Long gun and handgun checks were counted as 1.1 sales, and multiple-gun checks were counted as two sales. Permit and other types of checks were omitted. The mulitplier used in the survey were based on interviews Mr. Brauer had with gun shop owners.\n",
    "\n",
    "So background checks do not equal sales, but you can have a grasp of what gun sales are by visualizing this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "States cannot be directly compared\n",
    "In the visualization section, you will see statistics by state in some of the graphs. When looking at these, keep in mind that even though you can estimate gun sales using the NICS background check data, state laws for firearms differ from each other all across the nation. Even knowing this, the statistics between each state were still very interesting to learn about.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data Wrangling\n",
    "## The Gun Data\n",
    "The data used to explore the firearm background checks can be downloaded from a BuzzFeed News GitHub repository here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code in this GitHub repository downloads that PDF, parses it, and produces a spreadsheet/CSV of the data. Click here to download the data, which currently covers November 1998 – February 2018.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Census Data\n",
    "The population numbers come from the the United States Census government website here. This data has annual estimates of the resident population for the U.S. from April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2017.\n",
    "\n",
    "While exploring this data, I realized that I needed numbers for children under 18 within each state. As you'll see in the visualization, this was used to calculate how many people were of age to recieve a background check while buying a gun. That number was then used to calculate the percentage of checks compared to the population of that state.\n",
    "\n",
